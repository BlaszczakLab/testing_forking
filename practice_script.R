# Test R Script for GitHub Branching Training
# November 10, 2022
# Author: Heili Lowman

# The following script is meant to serve as a general sandbox area for
# practicing making changes to a collaborator's project while
# working on your own forked repository and then pushing those
# changes to the upstream (owner's) repository.

# My favorite food is:

# mashed potatoes

# End of script.
